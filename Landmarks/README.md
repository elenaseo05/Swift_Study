-------------- 
Section 1
Create a New Project and Explore the Canvas
Create a new Xcode project that uses SwiftUI. Explore the canvas, previews, and the SwiftUI template code.
To preview and interact with views from the canvas in Xcode, and to use all the latest features described throughout the tutorials, ensure your Mac is running macOS Big Sur or later.

Section 1
새로운 프로젝트를 만들고 캔버스(canvas)를 살펴보기.
SwiftUI를 사용하는 프로젝트를 Xcode에 만들고, canvas, previews, SwiftUI 템플릿 코드를 확인할 수 있다.
튜토리얼에 설명되어 있는 모든 기능을 사용하기 위해서는 macOS 가 Big Sur 이상되어야 한다.

Section 2
Customize the Text View
You can customize a view’s display by changing your code, or by using the inspector to discover what’s available and to help you write code.
As you build the Landmarks app, you can use any combination of editors: the source editor, the canvas, or the inspectors. Your code stays updated, regardless of which tool you use.

Section 3
Combine Views Using Stacks
Beyond the title view you created in the previous section, you’ll add text views to contain details about the landmark, such as the name of the park and state it’s in.
When creating a SwiftUI view, you describe its content, layout, and behavior in the view’s body property; however, the body property only returns a single view. You can combine and embed multiple views in stacks, which group views together horizontally, vertically, or back-to-front.
In this section, you’ll use a vertical stack to place the title above a horizontal stack that contains details about the park.



--------------

Section 4
Create a Custom Image View
With the name and location views all set, the next step is to add an image for the landmark.
Instead of adding more code in this file, you’ll create a custom view that applies a mask, border, and drop shadow to the image.




--------------

Section 5
Use SwiftUI Views From Other Frameworks
Next you’ll create a map that centers on a given coordinate. You can use the Map view from MapKit to render the map.




--------------


Section 6
Compose the Detail View
You now have all of the components you need — the name and place, a circular image, and a map for the location.
With the tools you’ve used so far, combine your custom views to create the final design for the landmark detail view.
